JxCoreDataStore
===============

JxCoreDataStore provides a easy way to use CoreData with SQLiteDB. 

Supports backgroundservice and replacing SQLite file with a new file on the fly.


# ViewController

JxFetchResultCollectionViewController and JxFetchResultTableViewController provides an easy way to interact with your CoreData results. Just add the Store and your filter before you show it so you will get the Results listet. 
Better way is to extend from this Objects to bring in your own cell configurations.
